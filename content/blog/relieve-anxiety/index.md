Anxiety is a normal emotion that everyone feels from time to time. But when anxiety becomes overwhelming or is present all the time, it can be difficult to cope and may even interfere with your daily life. Fortunately, there are effective treatments available for managing anxiety. One of these methods is Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as “tapping”. EFT uses acupressure points on the body combined with positive affirmations to help reduce stress and alleviate feelings of anxiousness. In this blog post, we'll discuss how eft works and how you can use eft tapping points to relieve your own anxiety.Do you feel overwhelmed by anxiety? Are your worries and fears keeping you up at night and making it hard to concentrate during the day? If so, you’re not alone. Anxiety affects millions of people every year, but luckily there are effective treatments available. One such treatment is Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as “tapping”. This method uses acupressure points on the body combined with positive affirmations to help reduce stress and alleviate feelings of anxiousness. In this blog post, we'll discuss how eft works and how you can use eft tapping points to relieve your own anxiety.

The Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), commonly known as tapping, is a simple but powerful tool for reducing anxiety and stress. It works by combining the principles of acupuncture and cognitive behavioral therapy to help you find relief from your anxious thoughts. Here's a basic eft tapping routine to help you relieve anxiety. 

Begin by finding a comfortable place to sit or lie down. Close your eyes and take a few moments to focus on your breathing. Feel the air entering and leaving your body with each breath, and allow yourself to relax into the moment. 

Once you’re feeling calm, begin tapping on the Karate Chop point. This point is located on the side of your hand near the base of your pinky finger. As you tap on this point, repeat an affirmation out loud such as “I am safe” or “I can handle this”. Keep repeating this affirmation throughout the routine if it helps you stay focused and relaxed. 



Next, move onto the Eyebrow point which is located at the beginning of your eyebrow near the bridge of your nose. Tap gently while repeating an affirmation such as “I accept myself exactly as I am” or “I trust my inner wisdom”. 



Continue tapping through other points including Side of Eye (near temple), Under Eye (below eye socket), Under Nose (above lip), Chin Point (between bottom lip & chin), Collarbone Point (on top collarbone) & Under Arm (4 inches below armpit). While tapping each point, think about any worries or fears that are causing you distress and remind yourself that everything will be okay in time. 



Finally, end with tapping on the Crown Point which is located at the very top of your head near the center of your scalp. Take some time here to express gratitude for all that is good in life, even if it doesn't always feel like much right now! When you're ready, open your eyes slowly and take a few deep breaths before getting up from where you sat/layed down earlier. 



This eft routine should be done twice daily or as needed when feeling anxious or overwhelmed by stressors in life. With practice, eft can help reduce feelings of anxiousness while also providing clarity around stressful situations so that thoughtful decisions can be made without being influenced by fear or panic-driven emotions.



Overall, eft is a powerful tool for reducing anxiety and stress. By combining the principles of acupuncture with positive affirmations and tapping on specific points throughout your body, you can help to reduce feelings of anxiousness while also gaining clarity in stressful situations. With practice and dedication, eft can become part of your daily routine so that you feel more empowered to take action without being influenced by fear or panic-driven emotions. If eft sounds like something that could benefit you, don’t hesitate to give it a try today!
