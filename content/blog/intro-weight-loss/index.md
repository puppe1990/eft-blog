Losing weight is a common goal for many people, but it can be a challenging and frustrating journey. Emotional eating, self-sabotage, and negative beliefs about weight loss can all contribute to a negative mindset that makes it difficult to achieve success. Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as tapping, is a powerful tool that can help shift our mindset around weight loss and promote a more positive and empowered mindset. In this post, we will explore whether EFT can really help with weight loss.

## What is EFT?

Before we dive into the effectiveness of EFT for weight loss, let's first understand what EFT is. EFT is a technique that involves tapping on specific acupressure points on the body while focusing on a specific issue or emotion. By tapping on these points, we can release negative emotions and limiting beliefs and promote a more positive and empowered mindset.

## How EFT can help with weight loss

EFT can be an effective tool for weight loss for several reasons. First, it can help release emotional eating and cravings. Many of us turn to food for comfort or as a way to deal with stress, anxiety, or negative emotions. By tapping on these emotions and releasing them, we can reduce our dependence on food as a coping mechanism.

Second, EFT can help release negative beliefs about weight loss. Many of us hold onto beliefs that make weight loss seem impossible, such as "I'll never lose weight" or "I have no self-control." By tapping on these beliefs and releasing them, we can shift our mindset and adopt a more positive and empowered mindset around weight loss.

Third, EFT can help release self-sabotage. Many of us engage in self-sabotaging behaviors that make it difficult to achieve weight loss goals, such as binge eating or skipping workouts. By tapping on the emotions and beliefs that contribute to these behaviors, we can release them and adopt more positive and productive habits.

## EFT Tapping Points for Weight Loss

Here are some of the EFT tapping points that can be used for weight loss:

- Karate chop point (side of the hand)
- Eyebrow point
- Side of the eye
- Under the eye

- Under the arm

## Sample Tapping Routine for Weight Loss
