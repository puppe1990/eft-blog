Physical pain can be debilitating and can affect our lives in numerous ways. It can prevent us from doing the things we love, it can interfere with our work, and it can even prevent us from sleeping. Unfortunately, traditional treatments such as medications and physical therapy may not always be effective in relieving pain. This is where Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) comes in. EFT is a type of psychological acupressure that has been used to help people cope with physical pain. But does it really work?What is EFT?Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT) is a form of psychological acupressure that was developed by Gary Craig, an American engineer. It is based on the principles of acupuncture, but instead of using needles, EFT uses tapping with the fingertips on specific points on the body. The tapping is done while the person focuses on a specific issue or problem, such as physical pain.EFT is believed to help reduce physical pain by releasing emotional blockages that can be causing the pain. It is also believed to help reduce stress, anxiety, and other negative emotions that can be causing or exacerbating the physical pain.

## Does EFT Really Work?
There is some evidence that EFT can be effective in reducing physical pain. A study published in the journal Pain Medicine found that EFT was effective in reducing pain in people with chronic pain. Another study published in the journal Complementary Therapies in Clinical Practice found that EFT was effective in reducing pain in people with fibromyalgia.However, more research is needed to determine the effectiveness of EFT for physical pain. While some studies have found that EFT can be effective in reducing pain, other studies have found that it is not effective. It is important to note that the studies that have found EFT to be effective have been small and more research is needed.
## Conclusion
EFT is a form of psychological acupressure that has been used to help people cope with physical pain. While some studies have found that EFT can be effective in reducing pain, other studies have found that it is not effective. More research is needed to determine the effectiveness of EFT for physical pain. However, for those who are suffering from physical pain, EFT may be worth trying as it may help to reduce pain and improve quality of life.
