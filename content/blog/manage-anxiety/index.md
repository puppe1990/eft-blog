Anxiety is a common experience for many people, and it can be overwhelming and debilitating. Fortunately, there are many techniques that can help manage anxiety, and one of the most effective and accessible is Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as tapping. EFT is a simple and powerful tool that can help alleviate anxiety symptoms quickly and easily. In this post, we will walk you through a step-by-step guide on how to use EFT to manage anxiety.

## Step 1: Identify Your Anxiety Triggers

The first step to using EFT to manage anxiety is to identify your anxiety triggers. Anxiety triggers can include situations, people, thoughts, or physical sensations that cause you to feel anxious. Some common anxiety triggers include public speaking, social situations, uncertainty, and physical symptoms such as racing heart or sweating. Once you have identified your anxiety triggers, write them down and rank them in order of severity.

## Step 2: Create Your Tapping Statement

Next, create your tapping statement. This statement should acknowledge the anxiety you are feeling and express a positive affirmation or affirmation of self-acceptance. For example, "Even though I feel anxious about speaking in public, I deeply and completely accept myself" or "Even though I'm feeling overwhelmed and anxious right now, I choose to focus on the present moment and trust that everything will be okay." The statement should be tailored to your specific anxiety triggers and should feel authentic and resonant.

## Step 3: Identify Your Tapping Points

There are several tapping points on the body that are used in EFT. These points correspond to traditional Chinese medicine meridians and are thought to help balance the body's energy system. The tapping points are located on the face, torso, and hands, and include the following:

* Karate chop point (side of the hand)
* Eyebrow point
* Side of the eye
* Under the eye
* Under the nose
* Chin point
* Collarbone point
* Under the arm
Step 4: Start Tapping

Once you have identified your tapping statement and tapping points, it's time to start tapping. To begin, take a deep breath and focus on your anxiety trigger. While continuing to focus on the trigger, tap gently on each of the identified points, starting at the karate chop point and moving through the other points in order. As you tap, repeat your tapping statement out loud or silently to yourself. After one round of tapping, take a deep breath and check in with your anxiety level. If you still feel anxious, repeat the tapping sequence for another round, or as many rounds as you need to feel calm and centered.

## Step 5: Evaluate Your Progress

After you have completed your tapping sequence, take a moment to evaluate your progress. Has your anxiety level decreased? If not, try modifying your tapping statement or focusing on a different anxiety trigger. With practice, you will become more attuned to your anxiety triggers and better able to use EFT to manage them.

In conclusion, using EFT to manage anxiety is a simple and effective tool that can be used by anyone, anywhere, at any time. By identifying your anxiety triggers, creating a tapping statement, and using the identified tapping points, you can quickly and easily alleviate anxiety symptoms and regain a sense of calm and balance. With consistent practice, EFT can become a powerful tool in your anxiety management toolbox.
