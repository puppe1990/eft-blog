Limiting beliefs can hold us back from achieving our goals, pursuing our passions, and living our best lives. These beliefs are often negative thoughts or attitudes that we hold about ourselves, our abilities, or the world around us. For example, a limiting belief may be "I'm not good enough," "I'm not smart enough," or "I'll never be successful." Fortunately, Emotional Freedom Technique (EFT), also known as tapping, is a powerful tool for overcoming limiting beliefs and creating a more positive and empowering mindset.

# What is EFT?

EFT is a simple and effective technique that involves tapping on specific points on the body while focusing on a specific issue, such as a negative belief or emotion. The tapping points correspond to traditional Chinese medicine meridians and are thought to help balance the body's energy system. By tapping on these points while focusing on a limiting belief, you can release negative emotions and beliefs and reprogram your mind for success.

Here's a step-by-step guide on how to use EFT to overcome limiting beliefs:

## Step 1: Identify Your Limiting Beliefs

The first step in overcoming limiting beliefs is to identify them. Take a few moments to reflect on your thoughts and attitudes about yourself, your abilities, and your potential. Write down any negative beliefs that come to mind, even if they seem insignificant or silly. Be as specific and detailed as possible.

## Step 2: Create Your Tapping Statement

Next, create your tapping statement. Your statement should acknowledge your limiting belief and express a positive and empowering thought or affirmation. For example, "Even though I believe I'm not good enough, I choose to love and accept myself just as I am" or "Even though I don't believe I can be successful, I trust in my abilities and my potential." The statement should feel authentic and resonate with you personally.

## Step 3: Identify Your Tapping Points

As with using EFT for anxiety or self-love, there are several tapping points on the body that are used for overcoming limiting beliefs. These points include the following:

Karate chop point (side of the hand)
Eyebrow point
Side of the eye
Under the eye
Under the nose
Chin point
Collarbone point
Under the arm

## Step 4: Start Tapping

Once you have identified your tapping statement and tapping points, it's time to start tapping. To begin, take a deep breath and focus on your limiting belief. While continuing to focus on the belief, tap gently on each of the identified points, starting at the karate chop point and moving through the other points in order. As you tap, repeat your tapping statement out loud or silently to yourself. After one round of tapping, take a deep breath and check in with your belief. If you still hold the limiting belief, repeat the tapping sequence for another round, or as many rounds as you need to feel a shift in your mindset.

## Step 5: Evaluate Your Progress

After you have completed your tapping sequence, take a moment to evaluate your progress. Has your limiting belief decreased or shifted? If not, try modifying your tapping statement or focusing on a different limiting belief. With practice, you will become more attuned to your negative beliefs and better able to use EFT to overcome them.

## Tapping routine Suggestion:

### Karate Chop Point:

- Even though I have this limiting belief that's holding me back, I deeply and completely accept myself and my feelings.

- Even though I feel stuck and helpless because of this belief, I choose to let it go and trust in my potential.

- Even though I've been holding onto this belief for so long, I am open to releasing it and creating a new, positive belief.

### Eyebrow Point:

- This limiting belief is holding me back from achieving my goals.

### Side of the Eye:

- It's been stopping me from realizing my full potential.

### Under the Eye:

- I feel stuck and helpless because of this belief.

### Under the Nose:

- But I'm ready to let it go and move forward with confidence.

### Chin Point:

- I'm choosing to release this belief and trust in my abilities.

### Collarbone Point:

- I am worthy of success and happiness, and I believe in myself.

### Under the Arm:

- I am letting go of this limiting belief and embracing a new, positive mindset.

Repeat this tapping sequence as many times as you need until you feel a shift in your mindset. Remember to be patient with yourself and trust in the process. With consistent practice, you can overcome limiting beliefs and achieve your goals.

In conclusion, overcoming limiting beliefs with EFT is a simple and effective tool that can help you create a more positive and empowering mindset. By identifying limiting beliefs, creating a tapping statement, and using the identified tapping points, you can release negative emotions and beliefs and reprogram your mind for success. With consistent practice, EFT can become a valuable tool in your personal growth journey, helping you to overcome self-doubt and achieve your goals. It's important to remember that overcoming limiting beliefs is a process that takes time and practice. You may need to repeat the tapping sequence several times before you start to see results. However, with a positive mindset and consistent effort, you can reprogram your mind and overcome any limiting beliefs that may be holding you back.

In addition to using EFT, there are other things you can do to overcome limiting beliefs and create a more positive and empowering mindset. Here are a few tips:

1. Practice positive self-talk. Use positive affirmations and self-talk to counteract negative thoughts and beliefs.

2. Surround yourself with positive influences. Spend time with people who have a positive attitude and who support your goals and aspirations.

3. Visualize success. Use visualization to imagine yourself achieving your goals and living the life you want to live.

4. Set achievable goals. Break down big goals into smaller, achievable steps, and celebrate your progress along the way.

By using EFT and following these tips, you can overcome limiting beliefs and create a more positive and empowering mindset. Remember, the key is to believe in yourself and your ability to achieve your goals. With a positive mindset and consistent effort, you can create the life you've always dreamed of.
