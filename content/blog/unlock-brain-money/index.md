Do you struggle with money? Maybe you have a hard time making it, managing it, or keeping it. Or maybe you feel like you're always in debt or never have enough to do the things you want to do. Whatever your money issues may be, there's a good chance that your money brain is blocking your financial success.

Your money brain is the part of your brain that's responsible for your beliefs and attitudes about money. It's the lens through which you view money, and it can either help or hinder your ability to achieve financial success. If you have negative or limiting beliefs about money, such as "money is evil" or "I'll never be rich," your money brain is likely blocking your path to financial success.

The good news is that you can unlock your money brain and reprogram it for financial success. One effective tool for doing this is Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT), also known as tapping. Tapping is a simple and easy-to-learn technique that involves tapping on specific points on your body while focusing on a particular issue, such as a negative belief or emotion. Tapping can help you release negative emotions and beliefs and reprogram your mind for success.

Here's a tapping routine you can use to unlock your money brain and achieve financial success:

## Step 1: Identify your negative beliefs about money.

Before you can start tapping, you need to identify your negative beliefs about money. What do you believe about money that might be holding you back? Write down your negative beliefs about money, such as "money is hard to come by" or "I don't deserve to be wealthy."

## Step 2: Rate the intensity of your negative beliefs.

Once you've identified your negative beliefs, rate the intensity of each one on a scale of 0 to 10. 0 represents no intensity, and 10 represents the highest intensity. This will help you track your progress as you tap.

## Step 3: Set up your tapping phrase.

Now that you've identified your negative beliefs and rated their intensity, it's time to set up your tapping phrase. Your tapping phrase should be a simple statement that acknowledges your negative belief and affirms a positive belief. For example, if your negative belief is "money is hard to come by," your tapping phrase might be "Even though I believe that money is hard to come by, I choose to believe that money comes to me easily and effortlessly."

## Step 4: Tap on the karate chop point.

The karate chop point is on the side of your hand, between your wrist and your little finger. Tap on this point while repeating your tapping phrase three times.

## Step 5: Tap on the other points.

Next, tap on the following points while repeating your tapping phrase:

Eyebrow point: On the inside of your eyebrow, near the bridge of your nose.
Side of the eye: On the bone at the outer corner of your eye.
Under the eye: On the bone just below your eye.
Under the nose: On the indentation between your nose and your upper lip.
Chin point: On the indentation between your lower lip and your chin.
Collarbone point: On the bone just below your collarbone, about an inch to either side of your breastbone.
Under the arm: On the side of your body, about four inches below your armpit.
Tap on each point while repeating your tapping phrase. Do two rounds of tapping on each point, and then take a deep breath and relax.

## Step 6: Re-rate the intensity
After completing the tapping sequence, re-rate the intensity of your negative beliefs about money. If the intensity has gone down, congratulations! You're on your way to unlocking your money brain and achieving financial success. If the intensity hasn't gone down, don't worry - just repeat the tapping sequence again, focusing on the same negative belief or a different one.

Remember, unlocking your money brain takes time and practice. You may need to repeat the tapping sequence several times before you start to see results. But with consistent practice and a positive mindset, you can reprogram your money brain for success.

In addition to tapping, there are other things you can do to unlock your money brain and achieve financial success. Here are a few tips:

Visualize your financial success. Imagine yourself achieving your financial goals and living the life you want to live. Visualize yourself feeling happy, confident, and successful.

Set SMART financial goals. SMART goals are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. Set clear and specific financial goals, and create a plan for achieving them.

Educate yourself about money. Read books, take courses, and seek advice from financial experts. The more you know about money, the better equipped you'll be to make informed financial decisions.

Surround yourself with positive influences. Spend time with people who have a positive attitude toward money and financial success. Avoid people who are negative or who bring you down.

By using tapping and following these tips, you can unlock your money brain and achieve financial success. Remember, the key is to believe in yourself and your ability to achieve your financial goals. With a positive mindset and consistent effort, you can create the financial future you've always dreamed of.
