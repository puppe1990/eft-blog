EFT, or Emotional Freedom Techniques, is an increasingly popular treatment for a wide range of psychological and physical issues. It is based on the idea that energy pathways in the body can be blocked, and when these pathways are unblocked, an individual can experience relief from their symptoms.

EFT is a form of psychological acupressure, which combines elements of cognitive-behavioral therapy, energy psychology, and Chinese medicine. It involves tapping on specific points on the body while focusing on a particular issue or emotion. This process helps to activate the bodyâ€™s energy system, allowing blocked energy pathways to be released and allowing the body to heal itself.

The aim of this blog is to provide an introduction to EFT. It will explain the history and development of the technique, the principles behind it, and the evidence that supports it. It will also discuss the potential benefits of EFT, and will provide an overview of the research that has been conducted on the effectiveness of the technique.

The blog will also provide an overview of the different approaches to EFT, as well as some practical tips for those considering using the technique. It will provide an introduction to some of the more commonly used techniques and will look at how to identify the right practitioner for you.

Finally, the blog will discuss the potential risks associated with EFT and will provide advice on how to ensure safety when using the technique. It will also provide information on common misconceptions about EFT and will provide links to further reading and resources.

We hope that this blog will provide a comprehensive overview of EFT and that it will help to demystify the technique. We believe that, when used correctly, EFT can be a very powerful tool that can help individuals to overcome a wide range of psychological and physical issues.
